The printf function in C-language is a widely used function that is used to output formatted text onto the console. It is defined in the header file stdio.h and is used to print formatted output onto the console. The function can be used to output strings, characters, integers, and floating-point numbers with varying degrees of formatting.<br><br>

The printf function works by taking a string as its first argument and then replacing the placeholders in the string with the appropriate values. The placeholders are denoted by a percent sign (%) followed by a formatting character that specifies the type of data being printed. For example, %d is used to print integers, %s is used to print strings, and %f is used to print floating-point numbers. <br><br>

The printf function also allows for additional formatting options to be specified. These formatting options can be used to specify the width of the field, the precision of floating-point numbers, and the justification of text. For example, the format specifier %5d would print an integer with a width of 5 characters, and the format specifier %10.2f would print a floating-point number with a width of 10 characters and a precision of 2 decimal places. <br><br>

The printf function can also be used to print special characters such as newlines, tabs, and backslashes. To print a newline, the escape sequence \n can be used, and to print a tab, the escape sequence \t can be used. <br><br>

In conclusion, the printf function in C-language is a powerful function that allows for formatted output to be printed onto the console. By using a combination of placeholders and formatting options, the function can be used to output a wide range of data types with varying degrees of formatting. <br><br>
